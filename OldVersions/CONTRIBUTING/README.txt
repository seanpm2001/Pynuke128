# CONTRIBUTING

This project is an archive of an old script I wrote that cannot perform its task, and even if it did, it would be too dangerous. I am showcasing it here due to the absurdity of it.

Currently, I don't have the source code on me, but I have an image of the source code. I am only welcoming 1 commit here, which is a transcribe of the 2321 byte source code.

I will allow someone else to do it before I attempt. Other than that, no contributions are allowed.
