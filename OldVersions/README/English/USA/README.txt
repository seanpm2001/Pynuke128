# Pynuke128
A script-kiddie script I made back in early 2020 which I tried to hide, as for whatever reason, I felt like with modification, this little thing could destroy the world. Oh how naive of me. My most embarrassing forkbomb project.

***

## Context

On the day I made this, I played around with the common recursive equation too many times, and I went out of my mind making this. I didn't go too far, as I felt like the part I didn't know much about could be used to overload and fry every server in the world.

I felt like I had an end of the world button for a while, but decided not to use it (even if it did work) as I didn't want to cause harm.

Within a couple months, I had gained more knowledge and realized that this was a extremely script kiddie project. The original plan of using Artificially Intelligent methods of brute forcing a fork bomb into a server was never used, but I feel like it would be easy to fix, as it isn't very practical anyways.
